# Project IUGV

## This repository contains all the codes used in the design and automation of the IUGV.

## IUGV stands for Intelligent Unmanned Ground Vehicle. IUGV is a project undertaken by the student chapter IE-Mechatronics, which is a part of the Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal. This project is focused on designing, prototyping and automating an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) for the purpose of remote area inspection. Under this project, we have designed and prototyped a three-wheeled differential drive UGV, which was manufactured using 3D printing and assembled. ROS was used to implement automation to read gauge values and return the same to the user using an onboard depth camera.

## The teams consisted of 
1. Robotics and Automation
2. Design and Assembly

The Design of the chassis and ----- was done using Fusion 360. Ansys was used to analyze the parts and the stability of the chassis. Generative design was used to make the front castor wheel attachment for better strength and performance and, at the same time, minimal material usage.
